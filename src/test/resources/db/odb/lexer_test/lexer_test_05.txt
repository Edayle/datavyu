; MacSHAPA Open Database; ; This database starts to get rough with the lexer.  The general idea is to ; generate all the errors and warnings that the lexer is capable of flagging.;; Needless to say, this is not a legal database, and will cause even more; fireworks if fed to the parser instead of just the lexer.;; This file deals only with errors that can be generated with reserved word tokens.;; This reserved word doesn't exist none-such ; and this one contains an illegal character none-Such; finally, this one has an unexpected end of file;; True in MacSHAPA but not in OpenSHAPA -- the class used to read the input file ; in MacshapaODBReader (java.io.BufferedReader) strips the new line character ; (be it \r or \n) from each line as it reads it.  That causes us to recognize the; end of file one character later than we used to -- hence we can no longer get ; an unexpected eof error in this context.  Instead we get another unrecognized ; token error.unxepected-eof
