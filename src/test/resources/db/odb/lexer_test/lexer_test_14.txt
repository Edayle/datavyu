; MacSHAPA Open Database
;
; This is a duplicate of lexer_test_06.txt, save with '\n' substituted for 
; '\r' throughout the file.  The purpose of the substitution is to verify that
; the Openshapa MacshapaODBReader class doesn't care whether new lines are marked
; with '\r' or '\n'.
; 
; This database starts to get rough with the lexer.  The general idea is to 
; generate all the errors and warnings that the lexer is capable of flagging.
;
; Needless to say, this is not a legal database, and will cause even more
; fireworks if fed to the parser instead of just the lexer.
;
; This file deals only with errors that can be generated with string tokens.
;
; This string contains an illegal escape sequence

" an illegal escape sequence follows: \]"

; This string contains a backspace

" the next character is a BS (0x08):"

; finally, an unterminated string

" this string is unterminated and thus ends in an EOF
