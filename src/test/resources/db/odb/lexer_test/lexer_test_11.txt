; MacSHAPA Open Database
;
; This is a duplicate of lexer_test_03.txt, save with '\n' substituted for 
; '\r' throughout the file.  The purpose of the substitution is to verify that
; the Openshapa MacshapaODBReader class doesn't care whether new lines are marked
; with '\r' or '\n'.
; 
; This database starts to get rough with the lexer.  The general idea is to 
; generate all the errors and warnings that the lexer is capable of flagging.
;
; Needless to say, this is not a legal database, and will cause even more
; fireworks if fed to the parser instead of just the lexer.
;
; This file deals only with errors that can be generated with numeric tokens.
;
; This integer has too many digits:

        10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

; and this is a negative integer with the same problem

		-100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

; This numeric token doesn't contain any digits:

-.

; This floating point value is too large (in terms of absolute value):

-1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

; This floating point value is too small:

0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

; This floating point value is both too large and contains too small a fraction

100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

; This is an example of the lexer being a bit too kind about accepting numbers.
; This will be lexed as two floating point numbers;

	1.1.1

; Finally, and end of file in a numeric token.  The lexer doesn't care about this,
; so it shouldn't generate an error
