; MacSHAPA Open Database; ; This database starts to get rough with the lexer.  The general idea is to ; generate all the errors and warnings that the lexer is capable of flagging.;; Needless to say, this is not a legal database, and will cause even more; fireworks if fed to the parser instead of just the lexer.;; This file deals only with errors that can be generated with private value tokens.;; This private value has a bad prefix<PRIVATE-VALUE>>; and this one has a bad suffix<<PRIVATE-VALUE>; this one contains and internal '<'<<PRIVATE<VALUE>>; and this one contains an illegal character<<PRIVATE-VALUe>>; this one contains a new line<<PRIVATE-VALUE>>; finally, this one has an unexpected end of file;; We still get an EOF error in OpenSHAPA, since the private value reader detectes the ; the end of a private value by reading the last character, instead of by looking at ; the lookahead character.  As a result, it can still encounter an end of file error ; in OpenSHAPA.<<UNEXPECTED-EOF
