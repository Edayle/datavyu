; MacSHAPA Open Database
; 
; This is a duplicate of lexer_test_02.txt, save with '\n' substituted for 
; '\r' throughout the file.  The purpose of the substitution is to verify that
; the Openshapa MacshapaODBReader class doesn't care whether new lines are marked
; with '\r' or '\n'.
; 
; This database starts to get rough with the lexer.  The general idea is to 
; generate all the errors and warnings that the lexer is capable of flagging.
;
; Needless to say, this is not a legal database, and will cause even more
; fireworks if fed to the parser instead of just the lexer.
;
; This file deals only with errors that can be generated with booleans and 
; a-list tag names.
;
; This shouldn't generate an error, but it should generate an unknown a-list tag token:

        NONE-SUCH>

; Now a mis-spelled boolean - this should generate a fatal error

		TRU

; and now an unexpected end of file error:
;
; True in MacSHAPA but not in OpenSHAPA -- the class used to read the input file 
; in MacshapaODBReader (java.io.BufferedReader) strips the new line character 
; (be it \r or \n) from each line as it reads it.  That causes us to recognize the
; end of file one character later than we used to -- hence we can no longer get 
; an unexpected eof error in this context.  Instead we get an unrecognizable
; token error.
